Some are only whitish, varicolored, , \\npainted - blotched with black, spotted. \\n\\nRuooY OCELot\\' \\n\\nIt is reddish, ruddy, blotched with chili-red, \\nblotched as with rubber. It is varicolored, variously \\nhued, ruddy. \\n\\nThe nature, the ways of this ocelot \\n\\nIt goes about eating the small animals, the deer, \\nthe rabbit, etc. And it is very reserved; no eater of \\noffal;0 very well kept. It bathes, washes, cleans itself; \\nit washes its face by licking, with its saliva. It pre-\\npares itself; it cares for itself. \\n\\nAnd by night it watches; it seeks out what it hunts, \\nwhat it eats. Very good, clear is its vision. In truth, \\nit sees very well; it can see far. Even if it is very dark, \\neven if it is misty, it sees. \\n\\nWhen it sees one, when it meets, when it comes \\nupon a huntsman, a hunter, it does not run, it does \\nnot flee. It just settles down to face him. It places \\nitself well; it hides itself not at all, this ocelot. Then \\nit begins to hiss, so that by its breath it may make \\nfaint, may terrify the hunter. And then the hunter \\nbegins to shoot arrows at it. The first reed, the arrow, \\nwhich he shoots, the ocelot just catches with its paws_; \\nit shatters it with its teetl1. It seats itself upon it \\ngrowling, snarling, rumbling in its throat. When \\n[ the hunter] shoots more, it is just the same; how-\\nsoever many he shoots at it, to all [ the ocelot] does \\nthe same. \\n\\nAnd the hunters have their reckoning (as well as \\ntheir custom) that they shoot only four times. If he \\nshoots four [arrows], the hunter is [ as good as] dead. \\nThereupon the ocelot prepares itself; it stretches, it \\nyawns, it stirs, it shakes itself; it cleans itself, it licks \\nitself. Then indeed it crouches, springs, flies through \\nthe air. Whether the hunter stands ten spans - even \\n\\n4. blac ocelot/: Mardn dcl Campo (/oc, eii .) suggests Fe/is glauc,,la \\n5.

Only \\n\\nonce does it leap - fly - swish - bristling, its hair \\n\\nrufBed. There dies the hunter; there he is eaten. \\n\\nBut the skilled hunter, when he shoots the first \\n\\narrow, if [ the ocelot] seizes it with its paws, then \\n\\ntakes an oak leaf [or] the petal of a tree Hower. At \\n\\nthe tip of the arrow he places it; with its tip he pierces \\n\\nit. Then he shoots it. The reed with the leaf goes \\n\\nfluttering; like a locust it goes perhaps half way, per-\\n\\nhaps by [ the ocelot]. When it Hies, when the oak \\n\\nleaf falls, [ the ocelot] is thus distracted. Thus the \\n\\nhunter succeeds in shooting it with an arrow; thus \\n\\nhe can reach it. \\nWhen the ocelot is shot, it leaps up. And when it \\n\\ncomes to fall on the ground, it sits up like a man; \\n\\nit sits up; it sits upright. It sits up as it first was. \\n\\nIt fixes its eyes upwards; it does not close them as it \\n\\ndies. It just remains looking; it seems to be alive. \\n\\nWherever the ocelot eats, first it hisses at one in \\n\\norder to terrify one - to make him swoon away. And \\n\\nits flesh burns like pepper. \\n\\nThe conjurers went about carrying its hide - the \\n\\nhide of its forehead and of its chest, and its tail, its \\n\\nnose, and its claws, and its heart, and its fangs, and \\n\\nits snout. It is said that they went about their tasks \\n\\nwith them - that with them they did daring deeds, \\n\\nthat because of them they were feared; that with \\n\\nthem they were daring.

But not of only one flavor is its \\n\\nflesh; all the various meats are in it : human flesh, \\n\\nwild beast flesh-deer, bird, dog, etc. \\n\\nThis tapir is quite rare. It lives there at Atzaccan, \\n\\nTepoztzotlan, Tlanquilapan, there in the great for-\\n\\nests, among the crags which no one reaches. It eats \\ntender shoots of tochquiquiztli and tender shoots of \\n\\ntlacalhuazquauitl when it finds no other food. When \\n\\nwild cacao grows-which no one plants-called \\n\\nteocacauatl and quappatlachtli, [ it eats these J and \\nmaize. When it comes upon a maize field, it finishes \\n\\nit all. When it defecates, it heaps up [ voided whole J \\ncacao bean.s, almost a carrier\\'s load. The common \\n\\nfolk hunt for these in the forest, in order there to find \\n\\nthe cacao beans. \\nIt is not frightening. It cannot be slain with an \\n\\narrow, even if shot with an arrow. In order to take it, \\nthey make it fall into a pit, a hole which they dig \\n\\ndeep-three arm spans deep. Such is its depth. When \\n\\nthey have dug it, they spread tree branches over it, \\n\\nthey cover it with grass. And it gives way. Later the \\n\\ntapir falls into the pit; there they spear it, so that there \\n\\nit dies. Later they draw it forth with heavy ropes. \\n\\nTzoN1zTAc10 \\n\\nIt is a wild animal which lives in Toztlan (and] \\n\\nCaseapan, almost by the ocean shore. As for its being \\n\\nnamed tzoniztac, its head is a pure white which ex-\\n\\ntends to its neck. It is rather large, something like an \\n\\nocelot, thick-bodied, squat. It goes about hunting \\n\\n[ other J wild animals. When it sees one, then it \\ngrowls much, it bares its teeth; then it pounces upon \\n\\nit Its fore [and] hind feet are like an ocelot\\'s; it is a \\n\\nvery high jumper which seemingly flies into the trees. \\n\\nAll \"its body - its forelegs, its hind legs - all arc glis-\\n\\ntening black. Its tail is long, just like an ocelot\\'s. \\n\\nNo one can easily find this tzoniztac. Whosoever \\n\\ncomes upon it, if he sees that its head is yellow, he \\nwho secs it will then die. But to whosoever sees that \\n\\nits head has not yellowed, it comes to pass that he will \\n\\ngrow very old; and its meaning is that he will be poor \\n\\neven if he lives still longer, even if he still works hard \\n\\nfor his living. If two, if perhaps three [ men see it], \\nall die; sometimes only one man is spared. They take \\n\\n10.

When it is already old, its tail is tangled. Every-\\n\\nwhere its fur is matted.

When \\nit \\n\\nhisses to terrify one, it is as if a rainbow comes from\\n \\n\\nits mouth. Very clever is it-a great stalker, a crouc\\nh-\\n\\ning spy. It stalks one; preys, hisses at one. \\n\\nMOUNTAIN LION\\n18 \\n\\nIt is just like all the ocelots, [but] nowhere are \\n\\nthere [ any spots] on it. It is completely smooth, very \\n\\nsmooth. However, it is very Jong-clawed, very hoo\\nk-\\n\\nclawed. Quite large are its dewclaws. It is da\\nrk \\n\\nyellow. [Some) are called ruddy mountain lion\\ns, \\n\\nyellow, blond mountain lions. The fur of some \\nis \\n\\nwhitish; they are called white mountain lions. \\n\\n}AGUARUNDI\" \\n\\nIt is the same as the mountain lion, but always\\n \\n\\nlives in trees, among tree-tops, where it gets its food. \\n\\nSeldom docs it walk on the ground. \\n\\nMA9AM1zn1\" \\n\\nIt is the same as the mountain lion. For this reason \\n\\nit is called mafamiztli: its fur is quite like deerskin. \\n\\nAnd quite similar [ to the deer\\'s J is its body, quite \\nsimilar are its head [and] its face. The male h\\n\\nas \\n\\nhorns; the female is like a doe. Quite similar [ to t\\nhe \\n\\ndeer\\'s J are its tail, its ears, its feet; quite similar [ to \\nthe deer\\'s hoof] are its claws. Nowhere else do th\\n\\ney \\n\\nresemble, nowhere else are they like a deer. In all, \\n\\nit differs from [ the deer], for it has teeth like\\n a \\n\\njaguarundi\\'s: it has the front teeth, the fangs, t\\nhe \\n\\nmolars. In short, it is a wild beast. \\n\\nI 1.

It eats absolutely the whole of it; it lies \\n\\ndown, lies digesting it. Hence it is called cuitlamiztli; \\n\\nbecause it is a glutton, and because it does not hide \\n\\nitself away. During the night it eats up the turkeys; \\n\\nit finishes them up if there are even twenty. When \\n\\nfilled, it just kills them and the sheep. \\n\\nlltNGTAIL\\n17 \\n\\nIt is the same as the cuitlamizt/i.

All hear its \\n\\nhowl. Then they go toward it. And when they have \\n\\ngathered around it, when they have circled about it, \\n\\nthen it seizes as many as it can to eat them.

Coyotl: probably several species of coyote. Martin dd Campo: \\n\\n(H:mnctonÂ·Smith). \\n\\n\\n\\nIt hunts in this way: it is a stalker, an ambusher. \\n\\nIt creeps; it crouches on the ground; it crouches spy- ,\\n \\n\\ning; it hides its feet [and] its ears; it looks with cau-\\n\\ntion; it looks from one side to another. As a stalker \\n\\nit is quite as astute as a man. And first it hisses, 1\\n \\n\\nwhether at birds, whether at sheep. Whatsoever it \\n1 \\n\\nwishes to catch it terrifies. \\n\\nAnd it is in every way diabolical. If I take from \\n\\nit, if I make it drop its catch, it will take vengeance, , \\n\\nit will repay me in kind. It also goes to take my \\n\\nanimals, which I raise. And if I [ should have J no , \\nanimals, it will await me on the road, confront me, \\n\\nbark at me as if it wished to eat me, to menace me. \\n\\nAnd it will engage two [ or J three of its companions \\nto mangle me, perhaps by night, perhaps by day. \\n\\nBut also this animal is grateful and appreciative. \\n\\nA short time ago, in our time, a man came upon a \\n\\ncoyote sitting on the grassy plain; the warrior was \\n\\ngoing along his way. And the coyote then beckoned \\n\\nto him with its paw. And the warrior was much \\n\\nfrightened and took it as an omen. \\n2 He went toward \\n\\nit, and when he came to reach it, he saw a serpent \\n\\nwhich was coiled around [ the coyote J. The serpent \\nprotruded from its neck, from under its front legs. \\n\\n[The serpent,] called a cincoatl, was thus well coiled. \\n\\nAnd the warrior said within himself, \"Which shall \\n\\nI help?\" Then the warrior went up, taking a stick, \\n\\na club, a green branch. Then he repeatedly beat the \\n\\nserpent with them; for the serpent abhorred the stick. \\n\\nThen the serpent fell to the ground; whereupon the \\n\\ncoyote staggered off. \\nAnd when it had revived, then it ran off. In per-\\n\\nhaps a couple of hours, farther on in the maize field, \\n\\nthe coyote went to look for the warrior who had \\n\\nrescued it. It brought him two turkey cocks, went on \\n\\nto throw them down, proceeded to push them on \\n\\nwith its muzzle almost as if to say to him, \"Take \\n\\nthem.\" Once again the coyote went. When the war-\\n\\nrior was going to his house, once more he met the \\n\\ncoyote on the road. It gave him another one, a turkey \\n\\nhen. And when the warrior had gone to his house, \\n\\nagain, a little later, it came to throw down another \\n\\nturkey cock in his courtyard. \\n\\nThe foods of this coyote are meat, raw meat, ripe \\n\\nmaize ears, green maize ears, green maize stalks, \\n\\ntomatoes, tunas, American cherries, tamales, tortillas, \\n\\nhoney. \\n\\n2.

This mouse is a little ashen, blackish, a \\n\\nlittle dark, rather yielding, a little soft. It is small and \\n\\nlong; it has a tail, a long, little tail.

When the various birds come, this is when it \\n\\ncomes; it brings them here at the time of the Feast \\n\\nof Santiago, in the month of July. \\n\\nAnd the head of this pelican is rather large, black. \\n\\nIts bill is yellow, round, a span long.\\n18 Its breast, its \\n\\nback are all white; its tail is not long; only average. \\n\\nIts legs have no long bones at all; its feet are at its \\n\\nbody. They are about a span long, very wide. Its \\n\\nbody is long, very thick. Its wings are not very large; \\n\\nits wing feathers are not very long. \\n\\nThis pelican does not nest anywhere in the reeds; \\n\\nit always lives there in the middle of the water, and \\n\\nit is said that it is the heart of the lagoon because it \\n\\nlives in the middle. \\n\\nAlso it sinks people. To sink them it only sum-\\n\\nmons the wind; it sings, it cries out. It sinks them \\n\\nonly when they try to catch it. To catch it they stalk \\n\\nit two, three, or four days. But if they fail to catch it \\n\\nby the third day, on the fourth day the water folk \\n\\nprepare themselves and then assemble and steel them-\\n\\nselves to go forth to die. For this is the custom of the \\n\\nwater folk. \\nFor this pelican, after four days, sits awaiting the \\n\\nwater folk; it rests on the water\\'s surface; it sits look-\\n\\ning at them. For if they fail to catch it in four days, \\n\\nby sunset, when the fifth sounds, the water folk thus \\n\\nknow it as a sign that they will die; for they who have \\n\\nfailed to catch it have been tried. \\n\\nAnd this pelican, when they have failed to shoot it \\n\\nby sunset of the fourth day, then calls out, cries out \\n\\nlike a crane; it summons the wind to sink the people. \\n\\nThereupon the water foams; thereupon the water \\n\\nbirds cry out exceedingly; they arrange themselves \\n\\nas it were in rows on the surface of the water: they \\n\\nbeat [ their wings]. All the fish well up. And the \\n\\nwater folk can no longer help themselves, although \\n\\nthey try hard to pole [ their boats]. Their arms are \\n\\n17. The ActZd. Hist. MS skips descriptions from this poin\\nt to Â§ 1. \\n\\n18. Corresponding Spanish text: \"el pico amarillo, redon\\ndo, y largo, , \\n\\n2\\\\ \\n\\n\\n\\nsimply numbed; it is as if someone pulls them down. \\n\\nSo there the water folk die; there the boat sinks. \\n\\nAnd when the pelican can be caught, when it can \\n\\nbe shot, perhaps they can shoot it, they can take it \\n\\nin two or three days. When the water folk shoot it, \\n\\nat once they seize it. They quickly, firmly grasp its \\n\\nbill; then they cast it into the boat. There they quickly \\n\\ndisembowel it [while] it still lives. They disembowel \\n\\nit with a dart [ with J three points at its head, called \\nminacachalli. \\n\\nThey seize it quickly, they grasp its bill firmly and \\n\\nquickly, so that it cannot regurgitate what is within \\n\\nit. For if they do not do so, it will at once regurgitate \\n\\nwhat is within it. Then they take it, whereupon they \\n\\ncut open its gizzard. Within is a precious green stone; \\n\\nand if not a green stone, various precious feathers are \\n\\nthere within, in its gizzard. And if they do not find \\na precious green stone or a feather, [but J only a piece \\nof charcoal appears there, this becomes a sign that the \\n\\nhunter will die. But for him who finds, who takes \\n\\nfrom it, a precious green stone or feather, it becomes \\n\\na sign that he always will be able to take, to capture, \\n\\nthe various birds or fish; he will prosper. Although, \\n\\nas has been said, all which he will eat will be at \\n\\nhand - the various birds which he will capture -\\n\\nhis grandsons will be in debt; they will indeed be \\n\\npoor. \\nAnd thus is the Aesh of the pelican eaten: all the \\n\\nwater folk assemble. They eat it only as a choice \\n\\nfood; only a very little is offered one. For it is verily \\n\\nthe heart of the water. \\nThis pelican also takes with it the different water \\n\\nbirds, when it goes. It goes there toward the west, \\n\\nwhere the sun sets. \\nThese water folk consider it as their mirror. For \\n\\nthere they see what each is to merit in their profes-\\n\\nsion as water folk. \\n\\nWATERÂ·TURKEY\\n10 \\n\\nIt comes after the pelican [as a waterfowl]. It is \\n\\nalso the heart of the water; it also is the leader of the \\n\\n[ water J birds. It also appears at the time that the \\nwater birds come, on the Feast Day of Santiago. \\n\\nIts head is as large as the turkey hen\\'s. The bill is \\n\\npointed, black, quite cylindrical; the outer edge of \\n\\nthe tip is yellow. Its breast is rather white. Its back, \\n\\nits wings are all ashen, blackish, like <luck feathers. It \\n\\n19. Acoiorl: A11hinga a11hinga (Linnacu~). Friedmann el al., op. cil \\n\\n\\n\\nis long-bodied. Its legs are thick, not long; they are \\n\\nat its rump, almost at its tail. Its feet are very wide, \\n\\nlike our hands. It also is rare; it also can sink one. \\n\\nAll told of the pelican also [applies] similarly to \\n\\nthe water turkey. \\n\\nWESTERN GREBE\\'\" \\n\\nIt is also rare. Likewise, it comes when the various \\n\\n[water] birds come. \\nIts head is quite small, black, with a pointed, chili-\\n\\nred bill. Its eyes are like lire. It is long-necked. Its \\n\\nbody is small and straight, small and thick: its breast \\n\\nvery white, its back black, its flight feathers white, its \\n\\nwing-bend tips black, its legs black: they are also \\n\\nsomewhat toward its rump, like a duck\\'s legs. \\n\\nIt lives there in the lagoon and is caught in nets. \\n\\nThis western grebe does not fly very high; some-\\n\\ntimes the water folk only chase it in boats; they spear \\n\\nit. And when they chase it, when they harass it ex-\\n\\nceedingly, when they are about to spear it, then it \\n\\nruflles up, cries out, summons the wind. The lagoon \\n\\nfoams much, it breaks into waves. So before the eyes \\n\\nof the water folk it vanishes, it sudden! y enters the \\n\\ndepths of the water. Occasionally they hit their mark; \\n\\n[ the bird] is successfully speared. Also it brings forth \\n\\nno young [here]; it also migrates. \\n\\nBLACK SKIMMER\\n21 \\n\\nIt flies high always at night there over the lagoon. \\n\\nIt is the same size as a dove. Its head is quite small, \\n\\nblack. Its breast is somewhat white, somewhat dark. \\n\\nIts back is black; its wings quite small. Its body is all \\n\\nsmall and round, its tail small, and its legs are like \\n\\na dove\\'s. \\nFor this reason is it called \"obsidian bill\": it has \\n\\nthree bills in all. Its food enters in two places, \\n\\n[ though J there is only one throat by which it swal-\\nlows it. It has also two tongues. Its [three] bills are \\n\\none over the other. \\nAnd if one captures this black skimmer, it is a sign \\n\\nthat he is about to die. And they say that his house \\n\\nwill be destroyed; his house folk will perish. For \\n\\nthis reason it is named a bird of ill omen. \\n\\nThe food of the black skimmer is water flies, flying \\n\\nants which fly high. \\n\\n20.

Its head is large, like Ihat of our native \\n\\nturkey cock ;28 its head is feaiherlcss, bald, bare to the \\nback of its head. The sides of its head are chili-red, \\n\\nreaching to its neck. It is long-necked. Its bill is very \\n\\nthick as well as cylindrical, long, like a bow. Its breast \\nis black. Its back, its wings are completely ashen, ex-\\ncept that Ihe wing-bends are very black. Its tail is \\n\\nshort, black. \\nThis wood ibis also comes when [water] birds \\n\\ncome. It is quite rare. \\nAnd when it is caught, it is considered an evil \\n\\nomen. Either some of Ihe lords will die, or war [ will \\n\\ncome]. li somewhere war breaks out, warriors will \\ngo off to die. Thus did Ihe water folk verify it: as \\n\\noften as they took wood ibis, so often Ihe city suffered \\n\\nsome harm, and so Ihey died. In times of old, as \\n\\nmany lords died, one by one, as the number of wood \\n\\nibis which Ihey had first taken, perhaps three, per-\\n\\nhaps two. \\nIts food is fish and all which lives in the mud. Its \\n\\nflesh is very good to Ihe taste. \\n\\nPURPLE GALLINULE\" \\n\\n\"\\' \\nIt likewise is rare. Also it comes when [ Ihe other \\n\\nwater] birds come. It is of average size, like a dove. \\n\\nFor this reason is it called \"mirror-head\": on its head \\n\\nis something like a mirror, a round [patch] on Ihe \\n\\ncrown of its head.25 There we appear. On Ihe front \\n\\nof its head is a thin row of feathers, somewhat ashen. \\n\\nIts bill is quite small, cylindrical. Its breast, its back \\n\\nare completely light blue; its wings, its tail arc like-\\n\\nwise light blue. All its feathers are a little white.2Â° \\n\\nIts legs are yellow. And when it swims, when it \\n\\npaddles with its feet in the water, it looks like an \\n\\nember; it goes glowing, glistening. \\nAnd the appearance of this purple gallinule was \\n\\n[ a sign of] war. Whoever captured one looked at \\n\\nhimself in the mirror. If he were to go, to go forth \\n\\nto battle, he saw that he was carried off, taken cap-\\n\\ntive; they dragged him away.

It i\\ns \\n\\nrather large, the same size as the Castilian chic\\nken, \\n\\nthe capon. Its head is dark yellow; its bill yellow\\nish, \\n\\nsmall, and cylindrical, about a span in length.\\n28 Its \\n\\nbreast, its back, its tail, its wings are all dark yello\\nw, \\n\\nslightly blackened; its legs, its shanks, are dark\\n. \\n\\nAnd for this reason is it called tolcomoctli: as i\\nt \\n\\nsings, it resounds. For this reason is it called atonc\\nue-\\n\\npot/i; when it sings, it is clearly heard to explode; i\\nt is \\n\\nvery loud. And it is called ateponazt/i because\\n it \\n\\nsounds from a distance like a two-toned drum\\n, so \\n\\nloud is it. \\nThis American bittern always lives here in t\\n\\nhe \\n\\nreeds; here it raises its young. It sits on only five,\\n or \\n\\nfour eggs. \\nFor these water folk this American bittern\\n\\n is \\n\\nalways a portent. When it sings a great deal, al\\nways \\n\\nall night, they know thereby that rains will com\\ne, it \\n\\nwill rain much, and there will be many fish -\\nall \\n\\nmanner of water life. But if it will not rain much,\\n \\n\\nif there will not be many fish, it does not sing much.\\n \\n\\nOnly perhaps every third day, after much time,\\n does \\n\\nit sing. \\nAcUITLACHTLI \\n\\nIt is much like the forest-dwelling wild beasts\\n.29 \\n\\nIt is as small as a small dog.

It lived there in Santa Cruz Quauhac\\nalco, \\n\\nwhere there is a spring [ whose water] comes to\\n San-\\n\\ntiago [Tlatelolco ].

Either they would also be drowned,\\n or a thun-\\n\\nder-bolt would strike them, so that they \\nwould also \\n\\ngo there to heaven, the place called Tlaloc\\nan. Hence \\n\\nthey were careful not to bathe much. \\n\\nAnd the villainy of this little animal I When\\n no one \\n\\nfell into its hands, when it drowned no o\\nne, then it \\n\\ndrove the fish, the xoxouilin, the amilotl, t\\nhe frogs up \\n\\nto the surface.

Then he continued \\nplacing the \\n\\nfish in the fold of his cape. This was ju\\nst the little \\n\\nbeast\\'s way of hunting people.

It did not throw him \\ninto terror as in the fable; it was only that he was \\n\\nsore afraid, and it blew a little upon him, that he died. \\n\\nA little old woman seized one; she covered it with \\nher shift. Then she cast it. into a water jar; she cov-\\n\\nered it with water. She carried it before the lords; \\n\\nthey looked at it well. Indeed they took the little ani-\\n\\nmal to be a god: it was said it was Tlaloc; it was said \\n\\nit was the priest. Then they commanded the little \\n\\nold woman to leave it there where she had gone to \\n\\ntake it. They told the little old woman she had done \\n\\nevil.

Then he takes off with them. \\n\\nAnd when the serpent has emerged, then i\\nt can see \\n\\nthat its fish have indeed been taken. It r\\naises itself \\n\\nup; it rises to run on its tail. It looks abou\\nt, twists its \\n\\nneck about repeatedly, looks to one sid\\ne and the \\n\\nother. No matter where this man goes, it ca\\nn see him. \\n\\nAnd it smells his footprints, wherever he is h\\neaded, \\n\\nwherever he has carried away his fish. \\n\\nThen it begins to run; it follows him as if flyi\\nng; \\n\\nit comes out sliding on the grass, on the shr\\nubs. When \\n\\nit goes to reach the one bearing fish on his\\n back, then \\n\\nit coils itself around him ; it coils many t\\nimes about \\n\\nhim. And its tail, since it is really forked, it\\n inserts \\n\\nin each of his nostrils, or in his anus. The\\nn the tlil-\\n\\ncoatl moves;â€¢ it squeezes the one who ha\\nd robbed \\n\\nhim. He then dies. \\nBut a discreet one, a foresighted one, \\n\\n3 first digs a \\n\\nhole at the base of a tree. When the serpe\\nnt pursues \\n\\nhim, he quickly hides himself in the tree, a\\nnd quickly \\n\\nenters, inserts himself into the hole there\\n. And this \\n\\ntlilcoatl then wraps itself about the tree; it c\\noils itself \\n\\nmany times, it stretches itself well. It s\\ntretches so \\n\\nmuch that it becomes very thin; its spine is \\nbroken up. \\n\\nThus this serpent dies there. \\n\\nAnd if someone just finds it or reaches t\\nhe place \\n\\nwhere the tlilcoatl lies, in order to seize \\nhim, this \\n\\ntlilcoatl first strikes him. It coils itself we\\nll. Then \\n\\nlike the shooting of an arrow it extend\\ns itself; it \\n\\nquickly straightens itself. And thus its ve\\nnom comes \\n\\nout; thus it casts it forth: like a rainbow\\n it rises up \\n\\nfrom its mouth. By it, he whom it hunts\\n is dulled; \\n\\nhe becomes just as if drunk. Then it attra\\ncts him \\n\\nwith its breath. This same man goes t\\noward the \\n\\npoisonous [serpent] - he goes violently\\n dragged, \\n\\nstruggling from side to side like a drun\\nkard. He \\n\\nenters the mouth of the poisonous [serpe\\nnt]. It car-\\n\\nries him off; it drowns him. \\n\\nIt follows one, runs, slithers, goes like t\\nhe wind, \\n\\n/lies, coils itself, hisses, blows; it strikes o\\nne, attracts \\n\\none with its breath, drowns one; it swallo\\nws things; \\n\\nit swallows one whole; it coils itself. \\n\\n2.

It is as if to say \"bracele\\nt snake.\" \\n\\nThis serpent is also named tetzauhcoatl. \\n\\nThis snake has a head at each end, and \\nalso a \\n\\nmouth at each end. It has teeth, it has ey\\nes, it has \\n\\ntongues at each end. It is not apparent ( if \\nthese are \\n\\nreally in its mouth (or)]\\n1 in its tail. And it is not \\n\\nlong; it is of average size. And it is painted:\\n four \\n\\nblack (stripes] are on its back. And ( the str\\nipes] are \\n\\nchili-red on its left side, and yellow on its r\\night side. \\n\\nAnd since it is really provided with a head \\nat each \\n\\nend, it can go nowhere when it is seen. To\\n travel, it \\n\\njust stretches itself out; to go along its wa\\ny, it just \\n\\nruns on both ends. \\nAnd it is called tetzauhcoatl because it rar\\n\\nely ap-\\n\\npears - only once in awhile; and it appea\\nrs in few \\n\\nplaces. \\nAnd thus did they delude themselves when \\n\\nthey re-\\n\\ngarded it as an omen; for this reason was it call\\ned a \\n\\nserpent of omen. Then one who saw it mad\\ne an \\n\\narmlet of it for himself. It was said that i\\nf he were \\n\\nabout to die it would very peaceably be cont\\nent on his \\n\\narm. That is, he had come to reach his tim\\ne to die; \\n\\nhis time had come to an end. But it is sai\\nd that no \\n\\none would die when he made of it an a\\nrmlet for \\n\\nhimself [and] it was not content on his ar\\nm; it was \\n\\nnot enough, as if it were not long [ enough J; it is a \\nlittle serpent. So they called it a serpent o\\n\\nf omen. \\n\\nIt is not poisonous. This is all about the\\n so-called \\n\\ntetzauhcoatl. \\nHence, those who go stirring up trouble, w\\n\\nho gos-\\n\\nsip, are named maquizcoatl; because it is\\n as if he \\n\\nspoke falsely, was a tale-bearer, like an e\\nvil omen. \\n\\nMAyACOATI.\\n2 \\n\\nIt is very big, very thick, dark.

It raises welts \\non one; it \\n\\nannoys one; it bites one, sucks one, ra\\nises welts on \\n\\none. \\nCALTATAPACH \\n\\nIt is a little ashen, small and flat, winged. Of tw\\no \\n\\nkinds are its wings: the part above i\\ns like sherds; \\n\\nbelow, it is so~ This is its flying part. \\n\\nWhen it bites one, its mouth makes \\none itch; it \\n\\nraises welts on one. Its dwelling place\\ns, its breeding \\n\\nplaces are in house cracks, in rubbishy \\nplaces, in \\n\\ndamp places. It comes out especially \\nwhen it is al-\\n\\nready the hot season, when the rains\\n have already \\n\\ncome. When it sees a torch, when it se\\nes a lire, there \\n\\nit casts itself. \\nPlNAUIZTLI \\n\\n[Its name] comes from \"I am asham\\ned,\" or \"I \\n\\nshame someone.\" It means \"the sham\\ning of one.\" \\n\\nThus the people of olden times named\\n it when they \\n\\nsaw it.

It is, as we say, a biter;\\n it has poison, \\n\\nit has venom. It is one which builds a ne\\nst for itself, \\n\\nbuilds a home for itself, makes an unde\\nrground house \\n\\nfor itself, hunts its food. It is a carrier, a t\\nransporter, \\n\\na storer of things. It is a wood-dragge\\nr, a dragger of \\n\\nthings. It carri:s, it drags wood; it hid~ th\\nings for \\n\\nitself. it hides thmgs, hunts food, gnaw\\ns things, makes \\n\\nitsdt\\'a nest, forms itself a mound, form\\ns itself a sandy \\n\\n1. Actzd. Hill, MS: 1Un1acapi1zpiJ is atld\\ncd. \\n\\n\\n\\nmound, forms itself a hill, forms itself an anthill; it \\nmakes a hill; it bites one. The ant which bites om \\ntorments one, injects one with poison, injects one \\n\\nwith venom. It lays eggs, it produces young. \\n\\nRn, ANT OR ANT OF RED ABDOMEN \\n\\nIt is somewhat average in size, a little firm, a littlc \\nhard, ruddy. It has a heap of sand, a mound of sand \\na hill. It sweeps, makes itself sand heaps, makes wide \\nroads, makes roads, makes itself a home. It is the \\n\\nworst one to bite. If it bites the foot, [ the effect J ex-\\ntends to the groin; if it bites the hand, it extends tc \\nthe armpit; it swells. \\n\\nLoNE ANT \\n\\nIt is a little large. It exceeds the red [ ant in red \\nness]. It is of very intense color, a little chili-red. Anc \\nit is as if ruddy-fuzzed. It is without special qualities \\nit just goes about. It is called \"lone ant\" because i \\ngoes about only alone; it does not go about in pairs \\nnor in threes, like the other ants. Yet many, in manJ \\nplaces, are seen, are met traveling separately. \\n\\nTREE ANT \\n\\nIt is named from quauitl [tree] and azcatl [ant: \\nbecause it Jives on trees, on rotten wood, where i \\nbreeds. And in size it exceeds, it compares with th, \\n\\nred ant. It is very long and straight; the arms ar, \\nvery long. It is thin. Some are black, some pale, som, \\n\\na little ruddy. When mature, they are also stingers \\nalso venomous, also like the red ant, also somethin1 \\nlike the lone ant. \\n\\nDUNG ANT \\n\\nIt is named from cuitlatl [ dung] and azcatl [ ant \\nbecause it smells of dung. Some of these are a littl, \\nashen, [ some J brown, some dark yellow. They breet \\nthere in maguey pith, in dung, in rubbish. Also the: \\ncling when they bite one; also they torment one. Arn \\n\\nnot just a few travel; very many travel; they travc \\nin a swarm. And as they travel along their way, the: \\ngo in good order, in procession, in a wide stream, o \\n\\nonly in single file. \\n\\nBLACK ANT \\n\\nIt is also called tzicatl. These Jive in cold land: \\nThey are very small; they breed underground, ii \\n\\nmaguey pith. And also they are rather inclined t, \\n\\nbite one. And when it is summer, its young are du, \\n\\n\\n\\nout; they are gathered. They are white, like w\\nhite \\n\\nworms. They are eaten; they are savory. Many\\n are \\n\\ncooked in an olla. Their name is really tzicam\\ne, or \\n\\nelse they are called azcamolli. \\n\\nTZICATI. \\n\\nIt is similar to the dung ant. It lives there in dam\\np \\n\\nplaces; and wherever anything edible or fat f\\nalls,\\' \\n\\nquickly they swarm there. And in hot lands \\nabso-\\n\\nlutely nowhere may anything fall or be placed, no\\nr \\n\\nanything remain long, [ for J then the tzicatl ants \\nform a mass; they eat it. \\n\\nTZICANANTLI\\n3 \\n\\nIt is a thick serpent which lives in the anthi\\nlls. \\n\\nWherever there are tzicatl or azcatl ants, there it\\n lives \\n\\nunderground. It is varicolored, spotted with va\\nrious \\n\\ncolors. It terrifies, it frightens one much. \\n\\nTZICATANA \\n\\nAlso it is called tepeuani. It is like the red ant. \\nIt \\n\\nlives in the cold lands. It is ruddy. And thus doc\\ns it \\n\\nlive: it cannot travel alone, but in a swarm. It is c\\nalled \\n\\n\"the conqueror\" because it eats everything th\\nat is \\n\\ntender. Whatever it clings to it no more rele\\nases; \\n\\nit consumes it, it sucks it dry. When they fo\\nllow \\n\\ntheir path, they go in a wide stream. So it is said they\\n \\n\\ndraw up for battle; so it is that they are conquero\\nrs. \\n\\nNEQUAZCATL\\' \\n\\nIt settles mainly underground; there it lives, th\\nere \\n\\nit breeds. And it is called \"honey ant\" becau\\nse its \\n\\nabdomen, its stomach, is sweet like wild bee h\\noney. \\n\\nIt is eaten. \\n1 \\n\\nTENTH PARAGRAPH, which tdleth of the small \\nin-\\n\\nsects whose dwelling place is on the ground. \\n\\nTLALXIQUIPILLI \\n\\nThe back is rounded, ball-like; the neck slender\\n, \\n\\nconstricted; the nose has hair, or horns.

Only when one sleeps do th\\ney come forth, \\n\\nand [among] dogs they appear when\\n they defecate. \\n\\nAll are called worms, in whatever putr\\nefaction they \\n\\nlive. \\nCHJANCUETLAN OR CHIENCUE\\n\\nTI.AN \\n\\nAlso they call them tetepolchichic. They\\n are thick, \\n\\npale, a little green; they have antennae. \\nThey are a \\n\\nspan long; they really frighten one. \\nThey are called \\n\\nchiancuetlan because the c hienquaui\\ntl tree is really \\n\\ntheir mother; right in it they are, they de\\nvelop. \\n\\nNEXTECUILIN\\n7 \\n\\nIt is like all the cinocuilin, ashen, c\\nhalky, green-\\n\\nbacked. Its dwelling is in the earth;\\n in the earth it \\n\\nhatches, it Jives. It eats earth. When it do\\nes not rain, \\n\\nit attacks the maize stalks; it cuts th\\nem at the root. \\n\\nAnd although there are its legs, it so\\nmetimes travels \\n\\nonly by going on its back. So for that\\n reason one who \\n\\nis not discreet is called nextecuilin : be\\ncause he does \\n\\nnot Jive as everyone [else] lives. \\n\\nCrNOCUILIN \\n\\nAlso its name is cenocuilin. This one\\n is ashen, like \\n\\nthe nextecuilin. This one lives right\\n on, hatches on \\n\\nthe green maize ears. It eats it, cuts \\nit up, until it is \\n\\na mature green ear, a dried, already d\\nried maize ear. \\n\\nIt is an eater of things, a cutter, a spoile\\nr, a destroyer. \\n\\nIt destroys, cuts up, chews up. \\n\\nTLA~LOCUILIN \\n\\nIt is of average size, a little ashen. It h\\natches right \\n\\nin rubbish; it lives right in it. It is a\\nn ordinary little \\n\\nworm, harmless. \\nCITLALOCUILIN \\n\\nIt is the same as the tlalomitl - pain\\nted like a star. \\n\\nIt lives, it breeds especially on the fr\\nuit of the nopal. \\n\\nCITLALOCUIL1N\\n8 \\n\\nThey are on, they form on mice, rabb\\nits, etc. They \\n\\narc like the ne:rtecuilin, or a little \\nlike the pafotl: \\n\\nfuzzy. The back is somewhat thic\\nk. Perhaps the \\n\\nmice, or whatever creature the worm\\n lives on, flees. \\n\\n?.

The neck is round. \\n\\nIt has arms, legs, wings, a shell. Underneath its shell, \\n\\nfrom there arc its wings, its place of flight. The time \\n\\nwhen it appears is when it is already rainy; then it \\nemerges; then it spreads out. \\n\\nCUITLATEMOLIN \\n\\nThey live in ordure, in dung. They arc just like the \\n\\nUmolin. \\nAYOXOCHQUILTEMOLIN \\n\\nThis one, which sucks the squash blossoms, is 2 \\n\\nlittle yellow. It is harmless. \\n\\nQUAUHTEMOLIN \\n\\nThis one hatches in the trees, on the trees. It ii \\n\\nruddy; it is a little large. \\n\\nQUAUHOCUILIN \\n\\nThis one hatches in wood;\\'0 it lives in it. It ii \\n\\nwhite. It is white, as nowhere does it see the sun. \\n\\nSome arc a little large, some very small. This one hai \\n\\na firm mouth, a tough mouth, a strong mouth, 2 \\n\\nmouth like metal. It is a cutter, a gnawer, a carver. \\n\\nIt gnaws, cuts, carves things. \\n\\n\\' FoUJITEENTII PAJIAGIIAPH, which tellcth of the little insects called fireflies, and of others like them. \\nlcPITL \\n\\nIt is whatever kind of insect shines at night. \\nOne kind of icpitl is called coquitl. It is like 2 \\n\\nlocust, a little long. When it rains, it travels at night \\n\\nThere arc very many of them. And its light is a little \\n\\nlarge, somewhat like a candle. Its light is on its tail \\n\\n- almost one-half of its body. For that reason it: \\n\\nlight is rather large. \\nAnd sometimes it shines like a pine torch, bccaus< \\n\\nof the dark.

It is a light, a \\nlighting; it \\n\\nglows. \\nA fifth kind is called copitl, which comes\\n\\n from \\n\\nnicopi [I close my eyes], because it goes sh\\nining, it \\n\\ngoes with light extinguished. Black are its win\\ngs. \\n\\nWhen it Hies, 1\\n when it appears, it glows. \\n\\nMAYATI.\\n2 \\n\\nIt lives in the hot countries. It is green; it gl\\nistens \\n\\nmuch.

It is called micc11fayo\\nlin be-\\n\\ncause it is said it is the lot of corpses. It bu\\nzzes, it \\n\\nflies violently, it hurls itself. \\n\\nXoPAN ~AYOLIN \\n\\nIt is small and round, green; it glistens, it glow\\ns. \\n\\nOnly in the summer does it appear.

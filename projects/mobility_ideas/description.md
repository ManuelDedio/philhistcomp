## Test
I think I start to understand how the interplay between atom and github works

### however...
Github keeps telling me that I don't have "write access" to our repository and whehter I'd like to create a fork. Not sure if this _normal_... The message appears every time when I want to commit changes to the master branch but then I am still able to push them to the repository.
